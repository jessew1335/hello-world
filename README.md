# hello-world
This is me jumping into the programming world :)

Hello,

I've been working as a helpdesk technician for about 6 years now. 3 years in the US Army and 3 in the private sector. after many times of having to make scripts to do the automated work i need on my domain i found that I've really enjoyed that part of my job the most so am now in my free time pursuing a career in programming to change that part and be able to enjoy going to work more often.
